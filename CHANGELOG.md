## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Custom process specifications can be added to the process builder after first initialization.

  - an array returned from a callback using the `array_create` process.

### Fixed

- Arrow functions can be used as callbacks in process graph building.

### Added

- Added new method `listCollectionItems` for searching and retrieving Items from `GET /collections/{collectionId}/items`.

### Changed

- Methods returning STAC (e.g. `listCollections`, `describeCollection`, `getResultAsStac`, `listCollectionItems`) always return the data compliant to the latest STAC version (currently 1.0.0-rc.1).

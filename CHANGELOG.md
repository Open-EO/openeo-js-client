## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New parameter `abortController` to allow cancellation of longer running requests (uploading files, sync. data processing).

## [2.2.0] - 2021-08-20

### Added

- New method `getUrl` to class `Connection` to get the main URL of the back-end, which the user provided (i.e. doesn't usually contain version part)

### Added

- Experimental support for process namespaces, see [API#348](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-api/pull/348).

### Changed

## [2.0.1] - 2021-07-14

### Fixed

- `Formula`: Formulas can reference more then just the first parameter by adding additional `$` at the beginning, e.g. `$$0` to access the first element of an array in the second parameter.

## [2.0.0] - 2021-07-06

### Added

- Added events to `Connection` to populate changes for Auth Tokens (`tokenChanged`) and Auth Providers (`authProviderChanged`).

- Default grant type for OpenID Connect is "AuthCode w/ PKCE" instead of "Implicit".
- Support for OpenID Connect session renewal via refresh tokens.
- Updated STAC support to STAC v1.0.0.

### Removed

- `OidcProvider`: Methods `getGrant`, `getScopes`, `getIssuer` and `getUser` removed. Use the properties `grant`, `scopes`, `issuer` and `user` instead.
